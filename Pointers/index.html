<h1>Pointers, new and delete</h1>

Pointers are typically confusing to students when they first learn them.
For better or worse, the standard template library in C++ lets you write
some very powerful programs without having to even acknowledge that 
that pointers exist.  However, pointers are fundamental and important.
The main reason is that often you want to have a piece of data that is
stored by multiple data structures.  And you want the data structures
to reference the same piece of data instead of each data structure
having its own copy.  This is why pointers are important.
<p>
You declare that a variable is a pointer to a data type with the asterisk.
For example, if I want the variable <b>ip</b> to point to an integer, I
declare it as:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int *ip;
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The pointer itself is a four or eight byte piece of data.  For now, think
of that data as being an arrow that points to other data.  In the above
code, it points to an integer.
<p>
You can set a pointer's value by having it point to a piece of 
data that already exists.  You do that using the ampersand.  
When you want to reference what a pointer points to, you use
the asterisk.  For
example, the program
<b><a href=src/pointer_mess_1.cpp>src/pointer_mess_1.cpp</a></b>
has the pointer <b>ip</b> point to the integer <b>i</b>, and
then does some setting and printing of that integer:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* A program to demonstrate single pointer that points to an integer. */</font>

#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int i;                     <font color=blue>// Declare an integer i</font>
  int *ip1;                  <font color=blue>// and a pointer to an integer, named ip1.</font>

  ip1 = &i;                  <font color=blue>// Set ip1 to point to i.</font>

  <font color=blue>/* When we change i, we can access that change either from i itself,
     or by "dereferencing" ip1 using the asterisk. */</font>

  i = 5;
  printf("i: %2d    *ip1: %2d\n", i, *ip1);

  <font color=blue>/* When we change *ip1, you see the change reflected in both i and *ip1. */</font>

  *ip1 = 10;
  printf("i: %2d    *ip1: %2d\n", i, *ip1);

  <font color=blue>/* This is like the first statement - changine i is reflected in both i and *ip1. */</font>

  i = 15;
  printf("i: %2d    *ip1: %2d\n", i, *ip1);
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>
When we run it, we see the following output:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>make bin/pointer_mess_1</b></font>
g++ -std=c++98 -Wall -Wextra -Iinclude -o bin/pointer_mess_1 src/pointer_mess_1.cpp
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/pointer_mess_1</b></font>
i:  5    *ip1:  5
i: 10    *ip1: 10
i: 15    *ip1: 15
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

I'll try to illustrate this with pictures below.  When you first declare <b>i</b>
and <b>ip</b>, that allocates space for them.  Setting <b>ip</b> to be <b>&amp;i</b>
has <b>ip</b> "point" to <b>i</b>.  Then, when you set <b>i</b> or <b>*ip</b>, it
sets the integer stored in <b>i</b>.  For that reason, printing <b>i</b> or <b>*ip</b>
prints the same value:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=jpg/pm1.jpg width=450></td></table></center><p>

The program 
<b><a href=src/pointer_mess_2.cpp>src/pointer_mess_2.cpp</a></b>
is a little more complex:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int i;
  int *ip1, *ip2;

  <font color=blue>/* This is like the previous program -- we set ip1 to point to i, and then after we
     set i's value to 5, you see that reflected in both i, and *ip1. */</font>

  ip1 = &i;
  i = 5;
  printf("i: %2d    *ip1: %2d\n", i, *ip1);

  <font color=blue>/* By saying "new int", we have allocated new memory for ip1.  It now points to 
     this new memory, and no longer to i.  For this reason, i's value remains 5, while
     *ip1 has been set to ten. */</font>

  ip1 = new int;
  *ip1 = 10;
  printf("i: %2d    *ip1: %2d\n", i, *ip1);

  <font color=blue>/* We have allocated another integer and set ip1 to point to it.  We have "lost"
     the memory from the first "new" statement, because we don't have any pointer
     to it.  This is known as a "memory leak." */</font>

  ip1 = new int;
  *ip1 = 15;
  printf("i: %2d    *ip1: %2d\n", i, *ip1);

  <font color=blue>/* We set ip2 equal to ip1.  That means they both point to the same integer, so when
     you set *ip2 to 20, that will be reflected in both *ip1 and *ip2.  You'll note that
     all this time, i has been unaffected, with its value remaining as 5. */</font>

  ip2 = ip1;
  *ip2 = 20;
  printf("i: %2d    *ip1: %2d     *ip2: %2d\n", i, *ip1, *ip2);

  <font color=blue>/* We allocate still another integer for ip1.  Since ip2 points to where ip1 was, this
     is not a memory leak.  At this point, i, *ip1 and *ip2 are all different values. */</font>

  ip1 = new int;
  *ip1 = 25;
  printf("i: %2d    *ip1: %2d     *ip2: %2d\n", i, *ip1, *ip2);

  <font color=blue>/* This deallocates the memory for ip1, so that it can be used for a new "new" call.
     You'll note that you can still print it out (or worse yet, set it).  That's because
     the memory doesn't go away; it is simply not allocated.  This is a memory bug, the
     worst of all bugs to find and fix. */</font>

  delete ip1;
  printf("i: %2d    *ip1: %2d     *ip2: %2d\n", i, *ip1, *ip2);
  
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>
This program has two pointers, <b>ip1</b> and <b>ip2</b>.  
The first statements are the same as the previous program -- <b>ip</b>
is set to be <b>&amp;i</b> and then <b>i</b> is set to five:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=jpg/pm2a.jpg width=450></td></table></center><p>

In the next set of statements, we call <b>new</b>.  This creates a new integer
and has <b>ip1</b> point to it.  This is called "allocating memory."  
This memory is guaranteed to exist until either the program ends, or 
you explicitly call <b>delete</b> on the pointer.  That makes it different
from local variables or procedure parameters which are created when a procedure
starts running and is reclaimed when the procedure ends.
Here's a picture -- you should see why the <b>printf()</b> statement prints out
<b>i</b> as 5, 
and 
<b>*ip1</b> as 10.

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=jpg/pm2b.jpg width=450></td></table></center><p>

In the next set of statements, we call <b>new</b> again and get the following picture:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=jpg/pm2c.jpg width=450></td></table></center><p>

Printing out <b>i</b> and <b>*ip1</b> yields 5 and 15.  However, you'll note that
the integer that holds 10 has nothing pointing to it.  This is called a <i>memory 
leak</i>, because that memory will not be deallocated until the program ends,
and no part of the program can access it.  Memory leaks are things that you want
to avoid, especially when you're writing programs that will run for a long 
time (like a web browser or editor).  

<p>

The next statements have <b>ip2</b> equal <b>ip1</b>.  In other words, they
point to the same integer.  Thus, when you change <b>*ip2</b> to 20, then
both <b>*ip2</b> and <b>*ip1</b> equal 20:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=jpg/pm2d.jpg width=450></td></table></center><p>

Now we call <b>new</b> again, so that <b>ip1</b> and <b>ip2</b> point to different
integers.  This is not a memory leak, because we can still access <b>ip2</b>.
Printing <b>i</b>, <b>*ip1</b> and <b>*ip2</b> all print different values.

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=jpg/pm2e.jpg width=450></td></table></center><p>

Finally, I call <b>delete ip1</b>.  This releases the integer so that the memory
can be reused by subsequent <b>new</b> calls.  You'll note that I still print out
<b>*ip1</b> -- the results of this may differ from machine to machine.  It
might print out the old value because the memory hasn't been reused, or
something else might happen.  This is a source of bugs that are extremely difficult
to track, and the compiler usually won't help.  This is another reason why
students hate pointers -- they can get you into trouble.  Regardless, you 
need to learn and understand them.

<h2>You can point to vectors</h2>

The program
<b><a href=src/pointer_mess_3.cpp>src/pointer_mess_3.cpp</a></b>
is more complex.  Instead of having pointers to integers, this one deals
with pointers to vectors.  You can read the comments if you want, but I will
also walk through the example with pictures after the code.

  printf("\n");
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>



I'll illustrate again.  First, we set <b>iv</b> to be a vector of the first 10 multiples
of 11.  Then we set <b>ivp</b> to point to <b>iv</b> and we print it out.
I use the <b>at()</b> method instead of square brackets just because it looks
better.  Instead of <b>ivp->at(i)</b>, I could have done <b>(*ip)[i]</b>, but
I don't like how that looks.  
<p>
When you have a pointer <b>p</b>, then doing <b>p->x</b> is equivalent to doing <b>(*p).x</b>.
It's easier to read.

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=jpg/pm3a.jpg width=450></td></table></center><p>

Next, I call <b>ivp->resize(4)</b>.  As you can see, that resizes the vector
to which <b>ivp</b> points, which ends up resizing <b>iv</b>:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=jpg/pm3b.jpg width=260></td></table></center><p>

The next part of the code will probably confuse you at first, but work through it.
<b>Ivpp</b> is a pointer to a vector.  The elements of the vector are pointers to 
integer vectors.  The <b>new</b> statement and two <b>push_back()</b> statements
create a new vector, which has two elements.  Each of them point to <b>iv</b>:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=jpg/pm3c.jpg width=266></td></table></center><p>

After printing <b>ivpp</b> we set <b>iv[0]</b> to -50.  Thus, when we print out
<b>ivpp</b> as before, both lines start with -50, since they point to the
same thing:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=jpg/pm3d.jpg width=266></td></table></center><p>

The final piece of code involving <b>vp</b> shows how I like to handle pointers
to vectors.  I usually like to bundle them up in a <b>class</b> or <b>struct</b>,
so that I don't have to use <b>at()</b> and it still looks nice.
<p>
Here's the output.  As with the previous program, make sure you understand
<i>every line of output</i> and why it happens.

Resizing ivp is reflecting by iv being resized.

Creating ivpp, and setting both of its elements to ivp.

(*ivpp)[0]:  0 11 22 33

Setting iv[0] to -50.  This will be reflected in both (*ivpp)[0] and (*ivpp[1])

(*ivpp)[0]: -50 11 22 33
(*ivpp)[1]: -50 11 22 33

This code demonstrates a pointer to a class whose member variable is a vector.

<h2>Sorting using the STL</h2>

The standard template library supports sorting of a vector.  You need
to include &lt;algorithm&gt;.
Then, to sort <b>v</b>, just call <b>sort(v.begin(), v.end())</b>,
as in <b><a href=src/sortlines1.cpp>src/sortlines1.cpp</a></b>.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program sorts the lines of standard input using the sort() procedure from
   the STL algorithms library. */</font>

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  vector &lt;string&gt; lines;
  string s;
  size_t i;

  <font color=blue>/* Read lines of standard input into the vector "lines".
     Sort the vector using the sort() procedure, and print the sorted lines. */</font>

  while (getline(cin, s)) lines.push_back(s);
  sort(lines.begin(), lines.end());
  for (i = 0; i &lt; lines.size(); i++) cout &lt;&lt; lines[i] &lt;&lt; endl;

  return 0;
}

</pre></td></table></center><p>
By default, strings are sorted lexicographically and numbers numerically (duh):

If you want to sort, but you don't want to use the default sorting mechanism,
you can provide your own comparison function.  It should take two parameters
of the same type as the vector (preferably const and reference) and return a <b>bool</b>
(true or false). It should return <b>true</b> if the first parameter is
less than the second, and false otherwise.  Therefore, the
following program 
(<b><a href=src/sortlines2.cpp>src/sortlines2.cpp</a></b>)
sorts standard input by the value of the second character 
in each line:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program uses a comparison function to sort a vector of strings by the
   strings' second letters, rather than the entire strings. */</font>

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std;

<font color=blue>/* Your comparison function takes as arguments, two const references to 
   the type that is in the vector (strings). */</font>

bool string_compare(const string &s1, const string &s2)
{
  if (s1[1] &lt; s2[1]) return true;         <font color=blue>/* I could have just said "return (s1[1] &lt; s2[1]);" */</font>
  return false;
}

int main()
{
  vector &lt;string&gt; lines;
  string s;
  size_t i;

  <font color=blue>/* This code is the same as before, except we pass string_compare() to the sort() procedure. */</font>

  while (getline(cin, s)) lines.push_back(s);
  sort(lines.begin(), lines.end(), string_compare);
  for (i = 0; i &lt; lines.size(); i++) cout &lt;&lt; lines[i] &lt;&lt; endl;

  return 0;
}

<h2>Data Structures that Share Data using Pointers</h2>

Your friend Zark Muckerberg comes to you, saying he's got an idea for an app that
will replace Facebook.  It's called ``Bacefook'', and 
it's going to be a huge hit and he's going to make a ton of money with it
and he's going to buy a great car and expensive clothes with the money and he'll
start making friends with movie stars and pro athletes and his life will be AWESOME!!!!
You're going to get some of that money too, 
because you're going to help him write the app.
<p>
The way that many apps work is diagrammed below:
<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=jpg/Server-Pic.jpg></td></table></center><p>
The app runs on people's phones, and then each app talks with a central server across
the Internet (or via a cellular network) using a networking mechanism like TCP/IP 
sockets.  You'll learn how to do that in CS360.
The server contains all of the data that gets shared among the apps.  When one app 
updates information, it is updated at the server so that the other apps may have 
access to it.  It's a nice and simple way of getting everything to work.
<p>
The apps are written on the platform of the phone (e.g. IOS or Android).  The server, 
though, is often a C++ program running on a Unix platform.  Now, Zark is going to 
write the apps, and he wants you to write the server.
<p>
To start with, Bacefook is going to manage people, who have just four attributes:
<OL>
<LI> A name, which can be composed of any number of words.
<LI> A mood, which can also be composed of any number of words.  If a person's mood is unspecified,
  then it is "Neutral."
<LI> Another person with whom they are in a relationship.  This attribute doesn't have to 
     be set, and it doesn't have be reciprocated.
<LI> A list of friends.  
</OL>
I don't think Bacefook looks much different than a really low budget Facebook, but what do
I know?
<p>
You'd be surprised at how unsexy a server is -- very often, they read lines of text from
their sockets, and write lines of text back to the sockets.  And they store data in 
data structures that you'll learn about in this class.
<p>
What we're going to do is write a very primitive server for Zark's app.  Instead of using
TCP/IP sockets, it's going to read from standard input and write to standard output.
We're just going to pretend that standard input comes from cell phones, and standard output
goes to cell phones.  Again, you'd be surprised at how close to reality this can be.
<p>
Our server is going to read lines of text.  It will read a "key," and then more information 
in subsequent lines.  Here are the keys that it processes:

<UL>
<LI> "NEW-PERSON" -- This must be followed by a line that contains the person's name.
The name can have any number of words.
This adds the new person to our server's database.
If that is successful, it will print "SUCCESSFUL" on standard output.  If unsuccessful
(the person is in the database already), then it will print "UNSUCCESSFUL".
<p>
<LI> "MOOD" -- This is followed by two lines.  The first contains a person's name, and
the second contains their mood.  The server finds the person and updates his or her mood.
The server responds either "SUCCESSFUL" or "UNSUCCESSFUL".

<p>
<LI> "IN-RELATIONSHIP" -- This is followed by two lines, which are the names of two people
in the database.  It registers the fact that the first person is in a relationship with the
second person.
Again, it will return "SUCCESSFUL" or "UNSUCCESSFUL".

<p>
<LI> "ADD-FRIEND" -- This is identical to "IN-RELATIONSHIP," except it adds the second person
to the first person's friend list.

<p>
<LI> "QUERY" -- This is followed by a line of text, which is the name of a person.
The output will be either "UNSUCCESSFUL", or the following lines of text:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> "QUERY SUCCESSFUL"
<LI> "NAME <i>Name-or-person</i>"
<LI> "MOOD <i>Mood</i>"
<LI> "IN-RELATIONSHIP <i>Name</i> : <i>Mood</i>".  It only prints this line if the person
 is in a relationship.  The mood is the mood of the other person.
<LI> "FRIEND <i>Name</i> : <i>Mood</i>"  -- there is one of these for each friend.
<LI> "END" - This makes it easy for Zark's program to know when the list of friends is over.
</UL>
</UL>


<hr>
<h2>bacefook_server.cpp</h2>
Let's write this one together.
The code is in <b><a href=bacefook_server.cpp>bacefook_server.cpp</a></b>, and it's
pretty straightforward.  I've even commented it!
The parts that I want you to pay attention to are the pointers.
<h3>The two main data structures: A person, and the hash table</h3>
<p>
Each person is represented with an instance of the <b>Person</b> class, defined below:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class Person {
  public:
    string Name;
    string Mood;
    Person *InRelationship;
    vector &lt;Person *&gt; Friends;
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

You'll note that <b>InRelationship</b> is a pointer to a person, and 
<b>Friends</b> is a vector of pointers to people.  That allows you to access each person's
data directly, and when it changes, you'll see the changes.
<p>
In reality, our "database" is a 
hash table that is accessed by names.  We'll use <b>djbhash</b>
as the hash function, and separate chaining to resolve collisions.  Each vector in the hash table
will hold a pointer to an instance of a <b>Person</b> class.  When we first insert that person
into the hash table, that's when we create the instance using <b>new</b>.
<p>
Take a look at the function <b>find_person()</b>.  It takes a name and a hash table,
and finds the person with that name in the hash table.  If the person is there, it returns
a pointer to the person.  If the person is not there, then it looks at the <b>add</b>
parameter.  If that parameter is true, it creates a new person (with <b>new</b>), and inserts
it into the hash table.  The person's <b>Mood</b> is "Neutral", and its <b>InRelationship</b>
pointer is set to <b>NULL</b>.  That is a special pointer value that points to "nothing."
If you try to dereference <b>NULL</b>, you'll get a segmentation violation.
The person's friend list is empty automatically.  The person is returned.
<p>
If <b>add</b> is false, then <b>find_person()</b> simply returns <b>NULL</b>.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>// This is our one and only hash table function.  It finds a person with the </font>
<font color=blue>// given name in the hash table.  If the person is found, then it returns a </font>
<font color=blue>// pointer to the person.  Otherwise, if "add" is true, it creates the person </font>
<font color=blue>// and adds it to the hash table.  If "add" is false, then it simpy returns NULL.</font>

Person *find_person(const string &name, vector &lt; vector &lt;Person*&gt; &gt; &HT, bool add)
{
  int h;
  size_t i;
  Person *p;

  <font color=blue>// Look up the person in the hash table.</font>

  h = djb_hash(name) % HT.size();
  for (i = 0; i &lt; HT[h].size(); i++) {
    if (HT[h][i]-&gt;Name == name) return HT[h][i];
  }

  <font color=blue>// If we're here in the code, we didn't find the person in the hash table.</font>

  if (add) {
    p = new Person;
    p-&gt;Name = name;
    p-&gt;Mood = "Neutral";
    p-&gt;InRelationship = NULL;
    HT[h].push_back(p);
    return p;
  } else {   
    return NULL;
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<h3>The basics of main()</h3>

The <b>main()</b> routine takes the size of the hash table on the command line.  
Then it sets up the hash table, and goes into an infinite loop reading lines of 
text from standard input:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  istringstream iss;                       <font color=blue>// For processing argv[1]</font>
  string n1, n2, mood;                     <font color=blue>// For reading in names and moods</font>
  Person *p, *p2;                          <font color=blue>// Pointers to people, that we manipulate or print.</font>

  int Table_Size;                          <font color=blue>// The table size is read from the command line.</font>
  vector &lt; vector &lt;Person*&gt; &gt; Hash_Table;  <font color=blue>// The hash table.  </font>
                                           <font color=blue>// Entries are vectors because we use separate chaining</font>

  size_t i;                                <font color=blue>// Temporary variable</font>
  string s;                                <font color=blue>// Temporary variable</font>

  <font color=blue>// --------------------------------------------------</font>
  <font color=blue>// Process the command line and create the hash table.</font>

  try {
    if (argc != 2) throw((string) "usage: bacefook_server table-size");

    iss.clear();
    iss.str(argv[1]);
    if (!(iss &gt;&gt; Table_Size) || Table_Size &lt;= 0) throw ("bad table-size");
  } catch (const string s) {
    cerr &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; endl;
    exit(1);
  }
 
  Hash_Table.resize(Table_Size);

  <font color=blue>// --------------------------------------------------</font>
  <font color=blue>// Process the input from standard input.</font>

  while (getline(cin, s)) {
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Now we process standard input.  Let's start with "NEW-PERSON".  You'll note, when
standard input ends, we simply exit the program.  When we read the person's name,
we call <b>find_person()</b> to look the person up in the hash table.  We set 
<b>add</b> to <b>false</b>, so that if the person is not there, <b>find_person()</b> 
returns <b>NULL</b>, and we can print "UNSUCCESSFUL."  Otherwise, we call
<b>find_person()</b> with <b>add</b> set to <b>true</b> to create the person 
and put him/her into the table:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
    <font color=blue>// --------------------------------------------------------</font>
    <font color=blue>// NEW-PERSON.  If the person is already in the hash table,</font>
    <font color=blue>// then it is an error.  </font>

    if (s == "NEW-PERSON") {
      if (!getline(cin, n1)) exit(1);
      p = find_person(n1, Hash_Table, false);
      if (p != NULL) {
        printf("UNSUCCESSFUL\n");
      } else {
        p = find_person(n1, Hash_Table, true);
        printf("SUCCESSFUL\n");
      }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Let's test what we've done so far.  At the very least, we should be able to add people
to the hash table, and if we try to add the same person twice, we'll be unsuccessful.

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bacefook_server 100</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>NEW-PERSON</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Scarlett O'Hara</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
<font color=darkred><b>NEW-PERSON</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Rhett Butler</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
<font color=darkred><b>NEW-PERSON</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Rhett Butler</b></font>
UNSUCCESSFUL
<font color=darkred><b>&lt;CNTL-D&gt;</b></font>
UNIX> 
</pre>

Let's set moods.  This is straightforward.  To test it, let's write the part 
of "QUERY" that prints out the name and mood:


<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
    <font color=blue>// --------------------------------------------------------</font>
    <font color=blue>// MOOD.  Find the name and set the mood.</font>

    } else if (s == "MOOD") {
      if (!getline(cin, n1)) exit(1);
      if (!getline(cin, mood)) exit(1);
      p = find_person(n1, Hash_Table, false);
      if (p == NULL) {
        printf("UNSUCCESSFUL\n");
      } else {
        p-&gt;Mood = mood;
        printf("SUCCESSFUL\n");
      }

    } else if (s == "QUERY") {
      if (!getline(cin, n1)) exit(1);
      p = find_person(n1, Hash_Table, false);
      if (p == NULL) {
        printf("UNSUCCESSFUL\n");
      } else {
        printf("SUCCESSFUL\n");
        printf("NAME %s\n", p-&gt;Name.c_str());
        printf("MOOD %s\n", p-&gt;Mood.c_str());
        printf("END\n");
      }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Here we'll change Scarlett's mood:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bacefook_server 100</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>NEW-PERSON</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Scarlett O'Hara</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
<font color=darkred><b>QUERY</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Scarlett O'Hara</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
NAME Scarlett O'Hara
MOOD Neutral
END
<font color=darkred><b>MOOD</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Scarlett O'Hara</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Impetuous</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
<font color=darkred><b>QUERY</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Scarlett O'Hara</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
NAME Scarlett O'Hara
MOOD Impetuous
END
<font color=darkred><b>&lt;CNTL-D&gt;</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>


Alright -- time for "IN-RELATIONSHIP".  Here, we get pointers to the two people,
and we set <b>p->InRelationship</b> to <b>p2</b>.  This is where it is important to have 
a pointer.  If we didn't use pointers in the hash table, and if <b>p->InRelationship</b>
were a <b>Person</b> instead of a pointer to a <b>Person</b>, then setting <b>p->InRelationship</b>
would make a <i>copy</i> of whatever is in the hash table.  
<p>
Here's the code.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
    <font color=blue>// ---------------------------------------------------------------</font>
    <font color=blue>// IN-RELATIONSHIP.  Now, you have to successfully find both</font>
    <font color=blue>// names.  Note how we set the pointer of p-&gt;InRelationship to p2.</font>

    } else if (s == "IN-RELATIONSHIP") {
      if (!getline(cin, n1)) exit(1);
      if (!getline(cin, n2)) exit(1);
      p = find_person(n1, Hash_Table, false);
      p2 = find_person(n2, Hash_Table, false);
      if (p == NULL || p2 == NULL) {
        printf("UNSUCCESSFUL\n");
      } else {
        p-&gt;InRelationship = p2;
        printf("SUCCESSFUL\n");
      }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

And here's the relevant line of "QUERY" -- note how we test 
<b>p->InRelationship</b> to make sure that we only print out the relationship
when it has been explicitly set:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
        if (p-&gt;InRelationship != NULL) {
          printf("IN-RELATIONSHIP %s : %s\n", p-&gt;InRelationship-&gt;Name.c_str(),
                    p-&gt;InRelationship-&gt;Mood.c_str());
        }
</pre></td></table></center><p>
To test this, let's change Scarlett's mood after Rhett has set his <b>InRelationship</b>.
Because we are using pointers, you see the mood change when you query Rhett:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bacefook_server 100</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>NEW-PERSON</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Scarlett O'Hara</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
<font color=darkred><b>NEW-PERSON</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Rhett Butler</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
<font color=darkred><b>IN-RELATIONSHIP</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Rhett Butler</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Scarlett O'Hara</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
<font color=darkred><b>QUERY</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Rhett Butler</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
NAME Rhett Butler
MOOD Neutral
IN-RELATIONSHIP Scarlett O'Hara : Neutral
END
<font color=darkred><b>MOOD</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Scarlett O'Hara</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Impetuous</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
<font color=darkred><b>QUERY</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Rhett Butler</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
NAME Rhett Butler
MOOD Neutral
IN-RELATIONSHIP Scarlett O'Hara : Impetuous
END
<font color=darkred><b>&lt;CNTL-D&gt;</b></font>
UNIX>
</pre>

Finally, let's add friends.  The code for this is very similar to "IN-RELATIONSHIP":

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
    <font color=blue>// ---------------------------------------------------------------</font>
    <font color=blue>// ADD-FRIEND.  This is pretty much identical to IN-RELATIONSHIP,</font>
    <font color=blue>// except you are adding p2 to the Friends vector, rather than just</font>
    <font color=blue>// setting a pointer.</font>

    } else if (s == "ADD-FRIEND") {
      if (!getline(cin, n1)) exit(1);
      if (!getline(cin, n2)) exit(1);
      p = find_person(n1, Hash_Table, false);
      p2 = find_person(n2, Hash_Table, false);
      if (p == NULL || p2 == NULL) {
        printf("UNSUCCESSFUL\n");
      } else {
        p-&gt;Friends.push_back(p2);
        printf("SUCCESSFUL\n");
      }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

And here's the code to print out friends in "QUERY":

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
        for (i = 0; i &lt; p-&gt;Friends.size(); i++) {
          printf("FRIEND %s : %s\n", p-&gt;Friends[i]-&gt;Name.c_str(),
                    p-&gt;Friends[i]-&gt;Mood.c_str());
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Let's test this.  I'm going to do a moderate-sized example 
of Margaret Mitchell's famous love triangle from <i>Gone With The Wind</i>.
Afterwards, we're going to take a very detailed look at how memory and the various data structures
are laid out.  I'm using a small hash table, because I want to be able to look at everything in 
my pictures.
<p>
Go ahead and cut-and-paste the following into <b>bacefook_server 10</b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
NEW-PERSON
Scarlett O'Hara

</pre></td></table></center><p>

If we do some queries on this state, we see all of those inter-relationships:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
<font color=darkred><b>QUERY</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Scarlett O'Hara</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
NAME Scarlett O'Hara
MOOD Petulant, Angry
IN-RELATIONSHIP Rhett Butler : Amorous
FRIEND Melanie Hamilton : Pious
FRIEND Ashley Wilkes : Limpid and Wimpy
END

<font color=darkred><b>QUERY</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Rhett Butler</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
NAME Rhett Butler
MOOD Amorous
IN-RELATIONSHIP Scarlett O'Hara : Petulant, Angry
END

<font color=darkred><b>QUERY </b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Ashley Wilkes</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL

IN-RELATIONSHIP Melanie Hamilton : Pious
END

<font color=darkred><b>QUERY</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Melanie Hamilton</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
NAME Melanie Hamilton
MOOD Pious
IN-RELATIONSHIP Ashley Wilkes : Limpid and Wimpy
FRIEND Scarlett O'Hara : Petulant, Angry
END
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Now, suppose we want to see what all of these structures look in memory.  
First, open another window and run <b>djbhash</b> from the
hashing lecture notes:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>djbhash</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Scarlett O'Hara</b></font>
1585424537
<font color=darkred><b>Rhett Butler</b></font>
3831887322
<font color=darkred><b>Ashley Wilkes</b></font>
2242265818
<font color=darkred><b>Melanie Hamilton</b></font>
1839425308
<font color=darkred><b>&lt;CNTL-D&gt;</b></font>
UNIX>
</pre>

That means that "Scarlett O'Hara" goes into hash table entry 7, 
"Rhett Butler" goes into hash table entry 2, and both 
"Ashley Wilkes" and "Melanie Hamilton" go into hash table entry 8.  
Armed with that knowledge, take a look at the hash table, the four <b>Person</b>
class instances, and all of their pointers.  There are three places where
pointers are used:
<p>
<OL>
<LI> From the hash table
<LI> From <b>InRelationship</b>
<LI> From the <b>Friends</b> vectors
</OL>
Each of these are colored with a different colored vector.   You should be able
to account for every pointer in the picture.
<p>
<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=jpg/GWTW-1.jpg></td></table></center><p>

Now, let's go back to the <b>bacefook_server</b> program, and change some things.
We'll reflect what happens at the end of "Gone with the Wind" -- Melanie dies, 
Scarlett professes her love to Ashley, Ashley dissolves into a weepy mess while
he pronounces his everlasting love for Melanie, and Rhett gets pissed:

<pre>
<font color=darkred><b>MOOD</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Melanie Hamilton</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Dead</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
<font color=darkred><b>IN-RELATIONSHIP</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Scarlett O'Hara</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Ashley Wilkes</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
<font color=darkred><b>MOOD</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Ashley Wilkes</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Weepy and still loving Melanie</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
<font color=darkred><b>MOOD </b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Rhett Butler</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Pissed</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
<font color=darkred><b>MOOD</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Scarlett O'Hara</b></font>
<font color=darkred><b>Jilted and angry</b></font>
SUCCESSFUL
</pre>

If you query them, you'll see all of those changes reflected.  Here's what the 
data structures look like now.  Again, you should double-check them.

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=jpg/GWTW-2.jpg></td></table></center><p>


<hr>
<h3>Summary</h3>

<UL>
<LI> A <i>pointer</i> is a special data type which provides a level of indirection.
It "points" to memory, which may belong to some other variables, or may be the exclusive
purview of the pointer.
<p>
<LI> You can set a pointer to point to another variable by putting an ampersand in front
of the variable.
<p>
<LI> You "dereference" a pointer by putting an asterisk in front of it.  That allows you to access
or set what the pointer is pointing to.
<p>
<LI> If a pointer <b>p</b> is to an instance of a class, 
then you can get at the methods and variables of
the class with <b>"p->"</b>.  That is cleaner than doing <b>"(*p)."</b>.
<p>
<LI> The <b>new</b> command asks for memory, and returns a pointer that points to it.
This memory will last until the program is over, of until <b>delete</b> is called on the pointer.
<p>
<LI> A "memory leak," is where you change a pointer, and don't record its old value.  If it was
     pointing to memory allocated with <b>new</b>, and there's no record of it anywhere, then it
     simply wastes space.  You want to avoid memory leaks.
<p>
<LI> When you call <b>delete</b>, the memory does not go away, but it is marked for reuse by 
     subsequent <b>new</b> calls.  This can cause horrific bugs when you forget that a pointer
     has been deleted.
<p>
<LI> One main reason why we use pointers is because we have data that we want to access in a 
     variety of ways.  The "Bacefook" example shows how we have multiple pointers to <b>People</b>,
     for example, in the <tt>Inrelationship</tt> pointer, and the <tt>Friends</tt> pointers.
</UL>
