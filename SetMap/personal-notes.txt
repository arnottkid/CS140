- When you get to the QB example, first just show them qb_1_read_input.cpp, and how you test it.
- Then, start with src qb_2_qbs_starter.cpp, and write the rest of read, and find.
  And go over the main().
- Test it.
- Try using an associative array for the find and go over that.
- Add Print_By_Rating() and do it wrong, using the associative array.
  - Test and discover why it's wrong.
- Use the multimap to do it correctly.
- Implement Print_By_Name() -- nested map.
- Test (two allen's)
- Implement Print_By_Team() -- straightforward.
- "On Destructors, Copy Constructors and Assignment Overload" -- Implement the destructor,
  and talk about copy constructor.
- Return value of insert -- setreturn.cpp
