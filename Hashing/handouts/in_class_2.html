<h3>In Class Problem #2</h3>
This was question 4 from the CS140 midterm in Fall, 2019.
<p>
Below left, I have 17 names, and what each name hashes to with two different hash
functions, H1 and H2.  The hash values are given in hexadecimal.
<p>
Below right, I have a hash table that has been filled in with some of these names.

Please answer the questions below.  Do not answer the questions as if one affects
the other.  Answer them all with respect to the tables above.  For example, you 
should not answer part <i>C</i> as if Austin Prissy were inserted into the table.
Instead, you simply answer with respect to the table above.
<p>
In all of the questions, assume that hash function H1 is used to insert into the table,
and if double-hashing is used, then hash function H2 is used as the second hash function.
<p>

<h4>For Class.  First, do parts <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>E</i>, and we'll go over the answers:</h4>

<i>A.</i> What is the load factor of the table (you can give a fraction here)?<br>
<i>B.</i> Into which index will Austin Prissy go into the table, using linear probing?<br>
<i>E.</i> Into which index will Noah Porous go into the table, using linear probing?<br>

<h4>Next, do parts <i>C</i> and <i>F</i>:</h4>

<i>C.</i> Into which index will Joshua Polonium go into the table, using quadratic probing?<br>
<i>F.</i> Into which index will Alexander Aeronautic go into the table, using quadratic probing?<br>

<h4>Finally, do the remaining parts:</h4>

<i>D.</i> Into which index will Maya Paddy go into the table, using double hashing?<br>
<i>G.</i> Into which index will Riley Predecessor go into the table, using double hashing?<br>
<i>H.</i> When using double hashing, Natalie Sober cannot be entered into the table.  Give me values of H1 ahd H2 that will make this happen.<br>
<i>I.</i> How do we know that Madison Willoughby was inserted into the table after Aiden Nepal?
