<h3>Where you are and where you are going</h3>

In CS102, you learned to program using an IDE, which is itself a program to 
facilitate C++.  The intent of this is to get the rewards of programming to
you quickly, without a lot of the frustrations that you get when you don't
use an IDE.
<p>
Starting in CS140, we're going to wean you from the IDE.  Rather quickly, in 
fact.  You are going
to learn how to write C++ programs in a Unix environment.  This will be far more
cumbersome than using an IDE.  However, it facilitates you learning about computers,
which is an important part of your education.
<p>
We're in a fortunate time in history (writing this in 2019) that all operating systems
have some version of Linux at their core.  So, whether you are running native Linux,
Windows or OSX, you should have access to a Linux shell with a C++ compiler.  
This needs to be the first thing that you do for this class -- besides learning how
to use the lab computers, you should make sure you have your own personal access to
a Unix environment.  Consult the TA's in lab if you have questions.  That's part of
their job responsibilities.

<h3>Learning Unix</h3>

I'll do some basic Unix in class.  However, Kevin Heard from Berkeley has written
a wonderful tutorial, available at
<a href=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~kevin/unix-tutorial/><i>http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~kevin/unix-tutorial/</i></a>.  Work through the first five chapters, plus chapter 8.  We
don't support <b>passwd</b>, so don't worry about that yet.  Also, don't spend too much time
learning <b>pico</b>.  You'll want to use a more powerful editor, like <b>vi</b> or <b>emacs</b>.
<p>
Since this tutorial does not cover file permissions, please also read 
<a href=http://www.perlfect.com/articles/chmod.shtml>this web page</a>, which discusses
file permissions and <b>chmod</b>.

<h3>Learning Vi</h3>

The editor <b>vi</b> is my editor of choice.  It is ancient, and getting it into your
muscle memory takes a little time and dedication.  It's worth it, in my opinion.  However,
you can use any editor you want: <b>emacs</b>, <b>pico</b>, even <b>TextEdit</b> or <b>Wordpad</b>.
Still, give <b>vi</b> a try, because <b>vi</b> helps to make you think like a 
Computer Scientist.
<p>
There is an updated verion of <b>vi</b> called <b>vim</b>.  It is free, and is the default
version of <b>vi</b> on our lab machines.  It is usually part of mac downloads, and you can 
configure <b>cygwin</b> to install it.  Better yet, on Windows, you can download a <b>vim</b>
program so that you can simply double-click it and it pops up a <b>vim</b> window.  Go
ahead and do that.
<p>
Then, go to <a href=http://www.vim.org/docs.php><i>http://www.vim.org/docs.php</i></a> and
download the book PDF and start working through the tutorial.   I know a low of <b>vi</b>
tricks and will use them in class.  If you see me do something and don't understand it,
ask and I'll back up and show it to you.

<h3>Files and Compilation</h3>

After wading through the Unix and Vi tutorials, you will be able to create
text files in your own directories.  In Unix, C++ programs are text files, typically with
the <b>.cpp</b> extension.  A program may reside in one file, or it may be spread over
many files.  We'll start with just one file for now.  
<p>
Our example program is the canonical "hello world" program, which is in the file
<b><a href=hw.cpp>hw.cpp</a></b> in the directory for these lecture notes
(<b>/home/jplank/cs140/Notes/Unix-Vi</b>).  Of course, if you click on that link, you
can save the program on your own computer.
<p>
I will always use "UNIX>" to denote my shell prompt.  I will usually have
keyboard input either boldfaced, or boldfaced and in red.  That helps you to figure
out what I'm doing with these lecture notes.
<p>
You cannot run a C++ file.  Instead, you have to "compile" it with a program called
a "compiler."  The compiler that we use is called <b>g++</b>.  If you run <b>g++</b>
on a C++ file, and there are no errors, it will generate an "executable" file.
By default, that file is named <b>a.out</b>.  You may run that file
by simply typing its name, preceded by "./" into the shell.  

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls</b></font>
hw.cpp
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -l</b></font>
total 8
-rw-r--r--  1 jplank  staff  98 Jan 11 13:22 hw.cpp
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>g++ hw.cpp</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls </b></font>
a.out	hw.cpp
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -l</b></font>
total 32
-rwxr-xr-x  1 jplank  staff  9776 Jan 11 13:29 a.out
-rw-r--r--  1 jplank  staff    98 Jan 11 13:22 hw.cpp
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./a.out</b></font>
Hello World!
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

In this example, I compiled <b>hw.cpp</b> and it created the executable <b>a.out</b>.
I ran it by typing "./a.out", and it printed "Hello World".  
<p>
The "<b>ls -l</b>" gives you a detailed listing of the files, including ownership (jplank),
last modification time (Jan 11 12:29 for <b>a.out</b>), size (9776 for <b>a.out</b>), and
"permissions."  Those are in the first word.  The x's in the listing for <b>a.out</b> mean
that it is a program that can be executed.  (BTW, if you compile this, you'll very likely 
get a different size for <b>a.out</b>, as it depends on your machine and compiler).
<p>
I can make g++ create the executable with a different name using the "-o filename" flag.  You put
that flag before the "source file" (the .cpp file):

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>rm a.out</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>g++ -o hw hw.cpp</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -l</b></font>
total 32
-rwxr-xr-x  1 jplank  staff  9776 Jan 11 13:33 hw
-rw-r--r--  2 jplank  staff   103 Jan 11 13:22 hw.cpp
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./hw</b></font>
Hello World!
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

When your program has errors, the compiler will print out error messages, and it will
not make an executable.  Sometimes figuring out what the error is difficult.  However,
you usually get a line number of the problem, meaning you can edit the source file,
go to that line, and try to figure it out.  For example, go ahead and modify hw.cpp
so that there is no semi-colon after "endl":


<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>vi hw.cpp</b></font>
... delete that semi-colon
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat hw.cpp</b></font>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout << "Hello World!" << endl         <font color=blue>// There's no semi-colon after endl</font>
  return 0;
}
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>g++ hw.cpp</b></font>
hw.cpp: In function "int main()":
hw.cpp:7: error: expected `;' before "return"
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

That's a nice error message -- you need a semi-colon on line 7.  Actually, it's line six,
but the compiler says 7 because it discovered the error when it read the "return" command.  
By the way, if you haven't used "cat"
before, it simply prints a file to the screen.  Fix the bug, recompile and rerun to double-check
yourself.  Now, edit it again, and delete the second quotation mark.  I'll use "cat -n" to 
print line numbers when it prints the file:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>vi hw.cpp</b></font>
... delete the second quotation mark:
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat -n hw.cpp</b></font>
     1	#include &lt;iostream&gt;
     2	using namespace std;
     3	
     4	main()
     5	{
     6	  cout << "Hello World! << endl;   <font color=blue>// There's now no quotation mark after '!'</font>
     7	  return 0;
     8	}
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>g++ hw.cpp</b></font>
hw.cpp:6:11: warning: missing terminating " character
hw.cpp:6: error: missing terminating " character
hw.cpp: In function 'int main()':
hw.cpp:7: error: 'return' was not declared in this scope
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>


That error printout is a little more cluttered, but it gets the point across.
Some are more difficult.  On my macintosh, when I try to compile that program,
I get vomit on the screen:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>g++ hw.cpp</b></font>
hw.cpp:6:11: warning: missing terminating " character
hw.cpp:6: error: missing terminating " character
hw.cpp: In function 'int main()':
hw.cpp:7: error: no match for 'operator<<' in 'std::cout << return 0 '

When you get that, just look at the first few lines and ignore the rest.  The first few
lines here help you diagnose the problem in the same way as on our lab machines.
