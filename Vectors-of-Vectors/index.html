Interestingly, vectors of strings don't seem to give students problems; however
vectors of vectors do, and the two are really not fundamentally different.  This
lecture gives you some practice with vectors of vectors.
<p>
Let's suppose that I want to represent a matrix of integers in 
C++.  The best way to do that is to use a vector of integer vectors.  
I will illustrate with the program
<b><a href=vdm.cpp>vdm.cpp</a></b>.
<p>

This program takes three command line arguments: <i>r</i>, <i>c</i> and <i>p</i>.
It then creates a <b>r * c</b> "Vandermonde" matrix over the field defined by the
prime number <i>p</i>?  What's a "field?"   In this case, it is the numbers 0 through <i>p-1</i>,
where addition, subtraction and multiplication are all modulo <i>p</i>.  Division 
is defined to be the inverse of multiplication, but don't worry about it, since it doesn't
really matter in this lecture.
<p>
A <i>Vandermonde</i> matrix is one that has the value <i>(i+1)<sup>j</sup>, mod p</i> in row <i>i</i> and
column <i>j</i> (everything is zero-indexed).  It has some very special properties concerning
invertibility of submatrices, but again, we don't care too much -- we just want to create
one and print it.  First, so you understand a Vandermonde matrix, here is one with five rows,
three columns and a prime of 17:
<b><a href=/dev/null>/dev/null</a></b>

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
         Col  Col  Col
          0    1    2
         ---  ---  ---  
Row 0 |   1    1    1   
Row 1 |   1    2    4   
Row 2 |   1    3    9   
Row 3 |   1    4   16   
Row 4 |   1    5    8   
</pre></td></table></center><p>

As you can see, the only time we had to do the modulo operator was for the element in row 4,
column 2.  That one is equal to 5<sup>2</sup>, which equals
25, but we take it modulo 17, so it eight.
<p>
Take a look at the code:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program creates and prints a "Vandermonde" matrix.
   The user will enter a number of rows, a number of columns, and a prime number, p.
   The Vandermonde matrix element in row i, column j is equal to (i+1)^j, mod p.
   Vandermonde matrices have interesting mathematical properties, which I won't
   go into -- if you take CS494 from me in a few semesters, you'll learn about
   some of them! */</font>

    for (j = 0; j &lt; vdm[i].size(); j++) {
      vdm[i][j] = val;

To start with, take a look at the way I declare the vector of vectors:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
  vector &lt; vector &lt;int&gt; &gt; vdm;       <font color=blue>// The Vandermonde matrix</font>
</pre></td></table></center><p>

It's a good idea to separate the &gt;'s and &lt;'s with a space.  On some copilers, "&lt;&lt;"
is interpreted as a keyword (like with <b>cin</b>) and you'll get a compiler error if you omit
the space.  Other compilers are ok with no space -- since you never know, it's best to be safe
and keep the space.  I will always have the space.

<p>
We start by resizing <b>vdm</b> to be the number of rows.  When we do that, each vector element 
is an empty vector.  We go through each of these and resize it to be the number of columns.  Now
our matrix has <b>r*c</b> element.

<p>
Next, we set the elements by running through each row, and setting
<b>base</b> to <i>(i+1)</i> and <b>val</b> to one.  Now we calculate
<i>(i+1)<sup>j</sup>%p</i> by multiplying the previous element, which
is <i>(i+1)<sup>(j-1)</sup>%p</i> by <i>(i+1)</i>.  
When we're done, we have an <b>r * c</b>
Vandermonde matrix.  The second set of <b>for</b> loops prints it out.

You should be able to verify to yourselves that all of the above matrices are Vandermonde matrices 
in their given fields.

<h3>Vectors of Vectors don't have to represent rectangular matrices</h3>

There's nothing that says we have to make each of the sub-vectors the same size.  
For example, consider Pascal's triangle.  This is a triangle of numbers
as pictured below:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Pascals-Triangle-1.jpg width=400></td></table></center><p>

The numbers are arranged in rows, where row <i>i</i> has <i>i+1</i> elements (as always, our
lives are zero-indexed).  The first and last element in each row is equal to one.  
Each other element is the sum of the two elements above it.  Suppose we want to write
a program to generate Pascal's triangle in a data structure.  One easy way to do 
this is to generate it as a vector of integer vectors, where element <i>i</i> of the
vector is a vector containing the elements of row <i>i</i>.  We can visualize it below:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Pascals-Triangle-2.jpg width=420></td></table></center><p>

Scanning for a pattern, let's consider the <i>j</i>-th element in row <i>i</i>.  
If it is the first or last element in the row, it will equal one.  Otherwise, you can 
see from the picture that it is equal to the sum of elements <i>j-1</i> and <i>j</i> in row <i>i-1</i>. 
That gives us a nice way to construct the triangle.  The code is in 
<b><a href=pascal.cpp>pascal.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program creates Pascal's triangle and prints it out.
   It stores Pascal's triangle as a vector of vectors. */</font>

#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;sstream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int r;                               <font color=blue>// The number of rows</font>
  vector &lt; vector &lt;int&gt; &gt; pascal;      <font color=blue>// The vector of vectors that holds Pascal's triangle</font>

  size_t i, j;
  istringstream ss;

  <font color=blue>/* Error check the command line. */</font>

  if (argc != 2) { cerr &lt;&lt; "usage: pascal rows\n"; exit(1); }
  ss.clear();  ss.str(argv[1]); if (!(ss &gt;&gt; r)) { cerr &lt;&lt; "Bad rows\n"; exit(1); }

  <font color=blue>/* Create an entry in the vector for each row.  Then add values to each row
     by using push_back() with either the value one, or the sum of two values
     on the previous row. */</font>

  pascal.resize(r);
  for (i = 0; i &lt; pascal.size(); i++) {
    for (j = 0; j &lt;= i; j++) {
      if (j == 0 || j == i) {
        pascal[i].push_back(1);
      } else {
        pascal[i].push_back(pascal[i-1][j-1] + pascal[i-1][j]);
      }
    }
  }

  <font color=blue>/* Print out the vector of vectors. */</font>

  for (i = 0; i &lt; pascal.size(); i++) {
    for (j = 0; j &lt; pascal[i].size(); j++) printf(" %4d", pascal[i][j]);
    cout &lt;&lt; endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

When we run it, it's pictured a little differently than above, but you should
see that it is clearly the same triangle:

<h3>Making Copies of Things</h3>

In C++, you can make a copy of an aggregate data structure with a simple
assignment statement.  We've seen it before with strings.  The program 
below,
<b><a href=vcopy.cpp>vcopy.cpp</a></b>, illustrates it with a larger 
data structure:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program illustrates how easy it is to make a copy of a potentially
   very large data structure.  It creates a 4x5 matrix of doubles, and then
   creates a copy of it with a single statement.  I then change a few values
   in the copy to verify that it is indeed a copy. */</font>
   
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  vector &lt; vector &lt;double&gt; &gt; v, vcopy;
  vector &lt;double&gt; dv;
  double val;
  size_t i, j;

  <font color=blue>/* First create the matrix v.  Mathmatically, entry i,j of v contains (5i+j+1)/9.0.  
     I's not really important what it contains -- I'm just filling it with some numbers. 
     Not also that I'm not using resize here, but I'm calling v.push_back() with a
     vector, which makes a copy of that vector. */</font>

  val = 1.0;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
    dv.clear();
    for (j = 0; j &lt; 5; j++) {
      dv.push_back(val / 9.000);
      val++;
    }
    v.push_back(dv);
  }

  <font color=blue>/* This single statement makes a copy of v. */</font>

  vcopy = v;

  <font color=blue>/* Zero the elements in the even columns of vcopy. */</font>

  for (i = 0; i &lt; vcopy.size(); i++) {
    for (j = 0; j &lt; vcopy[i].size(); j += 2) vcopy[i][j] = 0;
  }
  
  <font color=blue>/* Now print both v and vcopy */</font>

  printf("V:\n\n");

  for (i = 0; i &lt; v.size(); i++) {
    for (j = 0; j &lt; v[i].size(); j++) printf("%8.3lf", v[i][j]);
    printf("\n");
  }
  
  printf("\nVCopy:\n\n");

  for (i = 0; i &lt; vcopy.size(); i++) {
    for (j = 0; j &lt; vcopy[i].size(); j++) printf("%8.3lf", vcopy[i][j]);
    printf("\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The first few lines create a vector of vectors of doubles.  We can think of
it as a (4 * 5) matrix of doubles.  The next statement: <b>"vcopy = v"</b>
is one that is not legal in more primitive (and anal) languages like C.  
It makes a copy of 
<b>v</b> and puts it into <b>vcopy</b>.  You can see that in the subsequent
code that sets all the even indexed columns of <b>vcopy</b> to zero, and then
prints out both matrices:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./vcopy</b></font>
V:

   0.111   0.222   0.333   0.444   0.556
   0.667   0.778   0.889   1.000   1.111
   1.222   1.333   1.444   1.556   1.667
   1.778   1.889   2.000   2.111   2.222

VCopy:

   0.000   0.222   0.000   0.444   0.000
   0.000   0.778   0.000   1.000   0.000
   0.000   1.333   0.000   1.556   0.000
   0.000   1.889   0.000   2.111   0.000
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>


Since <b>vcopy</b> is a copy of <b>v</b>, changing <b>vcopy</b> does not affect <b>v</b>.
You'll hear me prattle on about memory a lot in this class, and this feature of C++
is in my opinion a very dangerous one, because it allows you to consume tons of memory
with very simple statements.  If <b>v</b> were a (1024 * 1024) matrix instead of a (4 * 5)
matrix, that one statement would consume 8 MB of memory.  In one operation!  I bring it
up because I want you to pay attention to the memory usage of your programs!

<p>
There is another large copy operation in 
<b><a href=vcopy.cpp>vcopy.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
  for (i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
    dv.clear();
    for (j = 0; j &lt; 5; j++) dv.push_back(drand48()*10);
    v.push_back(dv);
  }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

That <b>v.push_back(dv)</b> call makes a copy of <b>dv</b>.  If it didn't make a 
copy, all of the rows of <b>v</b> would be the same.
