We've already gone over basic constructors
in the <a href=../Classes/index.html>lecture on classes</a>.  In this lecture, I'm going to 
give them a more complete treatment, along with destructors and the assignment overload.

<hr>
<h3>Constructors, Parameters, Exceptions</h3>

The most basic constructor is one that does not take any parameters.  It is called whenever
you call a procedure that has the class declared as 
a local variable, and whenever you create a new instance
of a class with <b>new</b>.  Alternatively, you can define a constructor that takes parameters.
To call this constructor, you need to put the parameters into the declaration of the
local variable, or when you make the <b>new</b> call.  
<p>
The program <b><a href=src/const1.cpp>src/const1.cpp</a></b> defines a class called <b>My_Class</b>,
which has two constructors -- one with parameters and one without.  Both constructors print out
the fact that they have been called.  Then both the <b>main()</b> and <b>proc()</b> procedures
declare two instances of <b>My_Class</b>.  This means that the constructors will be called 
as soon as the procedures are called.  They both print some statements, and <b>main()</b> also
creates some <b>My_Class</b> instances with <b>new</b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
using namespace std;

<font color=blue>/* I'm declaring this class to have two constructors --
   one without parameters, and one with parameters. */</font>

class My_Class {
  public:
    My_Class();
    My_Class(int a, const string &s);
};

<font color=blue>/* The constructor without parameters prints the string,
   "Constructor called without parameters. */</font>

My_Class::My_Class()
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "Constructor called without parameters" &lt;&lt; endl;
}

<font color=blue>/* The second constructor prints out its parameters. */</font>

My_Class::My_Class(int a, const string &s)
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "Constructor called with parameters " 
       &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; " and " &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; endl;
}

<font color=blue>/* The procedure proc() simply declares two
  instances of My_Class, prints a line and exits.  */</font>
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
void proc()
{
  My_Class c3;
  My_Class c4(30, "Baby-Daisy");

  cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "proc begins and ends here." &lt;&lt; endl;
}

<font color=blue>/* Main has two My_Class's declared as local
  variables, and two pointers, where the My_Class
  instances are created with new. */</font>

int main()
{
  My_Class c1;
  My_Class c2(5, "Fred");
  My_Class *cp1, *cp2;

  cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "Main is starting" &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "calling: cp1 = new My_Class;" &lt;&lt; endl;
  cp1 = new My_Class;

  cout &lt;&lt; "cp2 = new My_Class(10, \"Luther\");" &lt;&lt; endl;
  cp2 = new My_Class(10, "Luther");

  cout &lt;&lt; "Calling proc():" &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; endl;
  proc();
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

When we run it, it runs to expectation, but you may find it confusing -- I've annotated
the output:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/const1</b></font>
Constructor called without parameters               <font color=blue># These are when main() starts running.</font>
Constructor called with parameters 5 and Fred

Main is starting                                    <font color=blue># Here's the main body of main().</font>
calling: cp1 = new My_Class;
Constructor called without parameters
cp2 = new My_Class(10, "Luther");
Constructor called with parameters 10 and Luther
Calling proc():

Constructor called without parameters               <font color=blue># These are when proc() starts running.</font>
Constructor called with parameters 30 and Baby-Daisy

proc begins and ends here.                          <font color=blue># And here's the body of proc().</font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

To handle errors in a constructor, you need to throw an exception.  To demonstrate, take a look
at <b><a href=src/const2_exception.cpp>src/const2_exception.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
using namespace std;

<font color=blue>/* I've gotten rid of the first constructor, and I'm
   making the second constructor throw an exception
   when its parameter a is zero. */</font>

class My_Class {
  public:
    My_Class(int a);
};

My_Class::My_Class(int a)
{
  printf("Constructor.  A = %d\n", a);
  if (a == 0) throw ((string) "Throwing exception");
}
<font color=blue>/* Proc declares two My_Classes -- one with 
   a value of 1 and a second one with a value 
   of zero.  It does a try/catch, but neither 
   will get called because c2's declaration
   throws an exception.  */</font>

</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
void proc()
{
  My_Class c1(1);
  My_Class c2(0);

  try {
    cout &lt;&lt; "In proc -- try\n";
  } catch (const string s) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "In proc -- catch " &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
}

<font color=blue>/* Main calls proc(), and catches exceptions. */</font>

int main()
{
  try {
    proc();
    cout &lt;&lt; "This line won't print" &lt;&lt; endl;
  } catch (const string s) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Caught " &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

When we call this, the flow of control works as follows:

<UL>
<LI> <b>main()</b> calls <b>proc()</b>.
<LI> <b>proc()</b> declares <b>c1</b>, which calls the constructor.  Since
the parameter <b>a</b> is 1, everything is ok.
<LI> <b>proc()</b> declares <b>c2</b>, which calls the constructor.  Since 
the parameter <b>a</b> is 0, the constructor throws an exception.
<LI> Although <b>proc()</b> has a "try/catch", the variable declarations
     are not inside the "try/catch".  For that reason, the exception is
     caught by <b>main()</b>.
<LI> <b>main()</b> prints out "Caught Throwing exception", and exits.
</UL>

Here it is running:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/const2_exception </b></font>
Constructor.  A = 1
Constructor.  A = 0
Caught Throwing exception
UNIX> <font color=darkred></font>
</pre>

This may seem confusing to you.  Make sure you can trace through code like this.

<hr>
<h3>Destructors</h3>

You can define a destructor for a class.  This is defined similarly to the constructor, but
you precede the method's name with a tilde "~".  Destructors are called primarily in two
places: 

<UL>
<LI> When the class instance is a local variable, and a procedure is returning.
<LI> When the class instance was created with <b>new</b>, and <b>delete</b> is called on the instance.
</UL>

Let's demonstrate with
<b><a href=src/const3_destructor.cpp>src/const3_destructor.cpp</a></b>.
This is identical to 
<b><a href=src/const1.cpp>src/const1.cpp</a></b>, except for the following things:

<UL>
<LI> I've added a destructor to the class definition:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class My_Class {
  public:
    My_Class();
    My_Class(int a, const string &s);
    ~My_Class();                       <font color=blue>// This is the destructor</font>
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<LI> I implement the destructor to print when it's called:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
My_Class::~My_Class()
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "Destructor called." &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre></td></table></center>

<LI> I call <b>delete</b> on <b>cp1</b> at the end of <b>main()</b>, 
     along with a few extra print statements:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
  <font color=blue>/* Here's the new code in main() */</font>

  cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "Calling delete on cp1" &lt;&lt; endl ;
  delete cp1;

  cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "Main is returning" &lt;&lt; endl ;
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>
</UL>

When we run this -- you can see that the destructor is called five times.  I'll
annotate:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/const3_destructor</b></font>
Constructor called without parameters
Constructor called with parameters 5 and Fred

Main is starting
calling: cp1 = new My_Class;
Constructor called without parameters
cp2 = new My_Class(10, "Luther");
Constructor called with parameters 10 and Luther
Calling proc():

Constructor called without parameters
Constructor called with parameters 30 and Baby-Daisy

proc begins and ends here.
Destructor called.                   <font color=blue># These two are for cp3 and cp4 in proc()</font>
Destructor called.

Calling delete on cp1
Destructor called.                   <font color=blue># This is from the delete call</font>

Main is returning
Destructor called.                   <font color=blue># These two are for cp1 and cp2 in main()</font>
Destructor called.
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

You'll note that no destructor was called for <b>cp2</b>.  That's because we never called
<b>delete</b> on it.  So we have a few important thing about destructors:

<UL>
<LI> Destructors are always called on local variables when the procedure exits.
<LI> Destructors are only called on pointers when you call <b>delete</b>.
<LI> If your program ends without calling <b>delete</b> on an instance of a class, then the
destructor will never be called.  That may be ok -- the memory is cleaned up by the operating
system.
</UL>

<h3>Destructors and exceptions</h3>

Time to have some fun.  Behold
<b><a href=src/const4_dest_except.cpp>src/const4_dest_except.cpp</a></b>.  Read the
opening block comment for a description:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
using namespace std;

<font color=blue>/* My_Class has a string, which it sets in the constructor. 
   It also has a destructor that prints the string.  This 
   program will make a few nested procedure calls, each of
   which has four My_Class local variables.  In the deepest
   nesting, I throw an exception, which I catch in main().
   I do this to show how all of the destructors get called
   as the exception travels back to main(). */</font>

class My_Class {
  public:
    My_Class(const string &s);
    ~My_Class();
    string my_string;
};

<font color=blue>/* The constructor sets my_string, 
   and the destructor prints it. */</font>
   
My_Class::My_Class(const string &s)
{
  my_string = s;
}

My_Class::~My_Class()
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "Destructor called. my_string = " 
       &lt;&lt; my_string &lt;&lt; endl;
}

<font color=blue>/* p1, p2, p3 declare four My_Class's.  
   p3 throws an exception. */</font>
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
void p3()
{
  My_Class c1("p3_c1"), c2("p3_c2"); 
  My_Class c3("p3_c3"), c4("p3_c4");
  throw(0);
}
void p2()
{
  My_Class c1("p2_c1"), c2("p2_c2"); 
  My_Class c3("p2_c3"), c4("p2_c4");
  p3();
}

void p1()
{
  My_Class c1("p1_c1"), c2("p1_c2"); 
  My_Class c3("p1_c3"), c4("p1_c4");
  p2();
}

<font color=blue>/* Finally, main() allocates one 
   My_Class, then calls p1(), 
   catching the exception. */</font>

int main()
{
  My_Class c1("main_c1");

  try {
    p1();
  } catch (int i) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Caught " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

When we call this, you'll note:

<UL>
<LI> <b>main()</b> calls <b>p1()</b>.
<LI> <b>p1()</b> calls <b>p2()</b>.
<LI> <b>p2()</b> calls <b>p3()</b>.
<LI> <b>p3()</b> throws an exception. 
</UL>

I do this to highlight the fact that when the exception is thrown, the following
things happen:

<UL>
<LI> Since the exception cannot be caught in <b>p3()</b>, <b>p3()</b> returns, 
     calling its four destructors.
<LI> Now, the exception cannot be caught in <b>p2()</b>, so <b>p2()</b> returns, 
     calling its four destructors.
<LI> Again, the exception cannot be caught in <b>p1()</b>, so <b>p1()</b> returns, 
     calling its four destructors.
<LI> The exception is caught in <b>main()</b>, so it prints out that it caught the
     exception. 
<LI> <b>main()</b> exits, which makes the last destructor call:
</UL>

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/const4_dest_except</b></font>
Destructor called. my_string = p3_c4
Destructor called. my_string = p3_c3
Destructor called. my_string = p3_c2
Destructor called. my_string = p3_c1
Destructor called. my_string = p2_c4
Destructor called. my_string = p2_c3
Destructor called. my_string = p2_c2
Destructor called. my_string = p2_c1
Destructor called. my_string = p1_c4
Destructor called. my_string = p1_c3
Destructor called. my_string = p1_c2
Destructor called. my_string = p1_c1
Caught 0
Destructor called. my_string = main_c1
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Starting in C++ 11, you can't catch an exception thrown in a destructor.  It has to do with
the program that you just saw -- if you need to call those destructors while catching an 
exception, then you shouldn't be throwing a new exception.   The impact: Just don't throw
an exception from a destructor.  
<p>
If you want to read typical arrogant and abusive blather on the topic, just Google "why can't i throw an exception in a destructor in C++" and read the prose on Stack Overflow...

<h3>Vectors, Constructors and Destructors</h3>

Suppose I make a vector of <b>My_Class</b> objects through resizing, and I don't specify a
default.  Then the constructor is called on every element of the vector, and when the procedure
exits, the destructor is called on every element as well.  I'll illustrate with
<b><a href=src/const5_vector1.cpp>src/const5_vector1.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
<font color=blue>/* We resize a vector of My_Class elements and 
   exit, just to see what the constructors and
   destructors do */</font>

class My_Class {
  public:
    My_Class();
    ~My_Class();
};
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
My_Class::My_Class()
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "Constructor called." &lt;&lt; endl;
}

My_Class::~My_Class()
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "Destructor called." &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
int main()
{
  vector &lt;My_Class&gt; v;

  v.resize(5);
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Here we go -- five constructor calls, and five destructor calls:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/const5_vector1 </b></font>
Constructor called.
Constructor called.
Constructor called.
Constructor called.
Constructor called.
Destructor called.
Destructor called.
Destructor called.
Destructor called.
Destructor called.
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Now, suppose we resize by giving a default value.  This is done
in 
<b><a href=src/const6_vector2.cpp>src/const6_vector2.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
<font color=blue>/* Now we resize with a default value. */</font>

class My_Class {
  public:
    My_Class();
    ~My_Class();
};
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
My_Class::My_Class()
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "Constructor called." &lt;&lt; endl;
}

My_Class::~My_Class()
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "Destructor called." &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
int main()
{
  My_Class c;
  vector &lt;My_Class&gt; v;

  <font color=blue>// We resize with a default</font>
  v.resize(5, c); 
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

When we run it, we only get one constructor call, and six destructor calls:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/const6_vector2</b></font>
Constructor called.
Destructor called.
Destructor called.
Destructor called.
Destructor called.
Destructor called.
Destructor called.
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

What gives? Well.....

<hr>
<h3>The Copy Constructor</h3>

You can define what's called a "copy constructor."  It takes a parameter, which is
a const reference parameter to an instance of the same type.  This is what's
called when you resize with a default.  The program 
<b><a href=src/const7_copy.cpp>src/const7_copy.cpp</a></b>
demonstrates:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program explores the copy constructor. */</font>

class My_Class {
  public:
    My_Class();
    My_Class(const My_Class &mc);
    ~My_Class();
};

<font color=blue>/* This is the copy constructor, which is called
   when a vector is resized with a default, or 
   when you call a procedure with an instance of
   the class as a non-reference parameter. */</font>

My_Class::My_Class(const My_Class &mc)
{
  (void) mc;
  cout &lt;&lt; "Copy Constructor called." &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
My_Class::My_Class()
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "Constructor called." &lt;&lt; endl;
}

My_Class::~My_Class()
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "Destructor called." &lt;&lt; endl;
}

void proc1(My_Class c)
{
  (void) c;
}

void proc2(My_Class &c)
{
  (void) c;
}
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
void proc3(const My_Class &c)
{
  (void) c;
}

int main()
{
  My_Class c;
  vector &lt;My_Class&gt; v;

  v.resize(5, c);
  cout &lt;&lt; "vector resized" &lt;&lt; endl;
  proc1(c);
  proc2(c);
  proc3(c);
  
  cout &lt;&lt; "returning" &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

You'll note that in addition to the copy constructor, I have three procedures:

<UL>
<LI> <b>proc1</b>, which takes a <b>My_Class</b> instance as a parameter.  It will make a copy
of this parameter, which will call the copy constructor.
<LI> <b>proc2</b>, which takes a reference to a <b>My_Class</b> instance as a parameter.
Since it's a reference, there's no copy being made, so no constructor is called.
<LI> <b>proc3</b>, which takes a const reference parameter.
This is just like <b>proc2()</b>.  The only thing that the <b>const</b> does is have the compiler
enforce the fact that you're not changing <b>c</b>.
</UL>

When we run it, we see that the copy constructor is called five times when we resize the 
vector, and then once when we call <b>proc1()</b>:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/const7_copy</b></font>
Constructor called.                 <font color=blue># This is for c</font>
Copy Constructor called.            <font color=blue># These five are when we resize the vector</font>
Copy Constructor called.
Copy Constructor called.
Copy Constructor called.
Copy Constructor called.
vector resized
Copy Constructor called.            <font color=blue># This is when proc1() is called - we copy the argument</font>
Destructor called.                  <font color=blue># This is when proc1() returns</font>
returning                           <font color=blue># Main() prints this right before it returns</font>
Destructor called.                  <font color=blue># There are six of these - 5 for the vector, and one for c</font>
Destructor called.
Destructor called.
Destructor called.
Destructor called.
Destructor called.
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

If you don't define a copy constructor, a default is defined for you, that 
simply copies each member variable of the 
class.  Typically, that's what you want, so you don't define a copy constructor.  Think about that
in our bitmatrix lab -- the only member variable is a vector <b>M</b>.  The copy constructor
copies that vector, so it does exctly what you want.
If your class does some weird stuff, (typically involving pointers or open files),
you'll want to rewrite the copy constructor.

<hr>
<h3>This</h3>

When you are implementing a method in C++, you can access a pointer to the instance of your
class with <b>this</b>.  Let me give a really simple example, which is not a good example of
program design, but at least illustrates <b>this</b>.   Here we have a class <b>Person</b>
with member variables <b>Name</b> and <b>Age</b>.  There is also a <b>Print()</b> method.
We have an additional procedure <b>Print_Person()</b> which takes a pointer to a <b>Person</b>,
and prints it out with some formatting.  
<p>
To implement the <b>Print()</b> method, we simply call <b>Print_Person()</b> on <b>this</b>, which
is a pointer to the class.  Take a look (in
<b><a href=src/this.cpp>src/this.cpp</a></b>).

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* A program to demonstrate "this" */</font>

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
using namespace std;

class Person {
  public:
    string Name;
    int Age;
    void Print(); 
};

<font color=blue>/* Print_Person() takes a pointer to a person, and prints out
   the person with some formatting. */</font>

void Print_Person(Person *p)
{
  printf("Person: %s - Age = %d\n", p-&gt;Name.c_str(), p-&gt;Age);
}

<font color=blue>/* The Print() method uses Print_Person() -- this is a pointer
   to the instance which is calling Print(). */</font>

void Person::Print()
{
  Print_Person(this);
}

<font color=blue>/* In main(), we read in pairs of (name,age), and then use the
   Print() method of the Person class to print the person. */</font>

int main()
{
  Person p;
  
  while (cin &gt;&gt; p.Name &gt;&gt; p.Age) p.Print();
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

We run it by passing two pairs of names and ages to standard input -- as you can see, the
<b>Print()</b> method calls <b>Print_Person()</b>, using <b>this</b> as a pointer to the 
<b>Person</b> calling <b>Print()</b>:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>echo Fred 5 Luther 55 | bin/this</b></font>
Person: Fred - Age = 5
Person: Luther - Age = 55
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

<hr>
<h3>Overloading the assigment operator</h3>

C++ allows you to "overload" operators -- this allows you do to things like define what "+"
means for a class.  Sometimes that's nice (like having "+" be string concatenation in the
string class).  More often than not, it's confusing, which is why I don't teach much concerning
operator overloading.
<p>
Much like the copy constructor, each class has a default assignment operator.  This is the equals
sign.  If you say:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
a = b;
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Where <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are instances of a class, the default action is for <b>a</b> to 
receive a copy of each of <b>b</b>'s member variables.  More often than not, this is what
you want.  However, there are times when it's not, and when that's the case, you can redefine it.
Let me show you an example, which is contrived, but it demonstrates how you can redefine the 
operator.   It's in 
<b><a href=src/overload.cpp>src/overload.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* A program to show an assignment overload */</font>

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
using namespace std;

class Crazy_Class {
  public:
    int value;
    Crazy_Class& operator= (const Crazy_Class &cc);
};

<font color=blue>/* The assignment overload copies value+1 from the original class. */</font>

Crazy_Class& Crazy_Class::operator= (const Crazy_Class &cc)
{
  value = cc.value+1;
  return *this;
}

int main()
{
  Crazy_Class c1, c2;

  c1.value = 5;
  c2 = c1;                    <font color=blue>// This will call the overload, and set c2.value to 6.</font>
  cout &lt;&lt; c2.value &lt;&lt; endl;   <font color=blue>// This prints 6.</font>
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The assignment overload copies <b>value+1</b> to value.  So, when you say "c2 = c1", it calls
the assignment overload, and sets <b>c2.value</b> to <b>(c1.value+1)</b>=6.  Again, this example
is contrived, but there are times, again when you're using pointers or open files in a class,
that you'll want to redefine the assignment overload.

<h3>Some Opinions From Dr. Plank</h3>

As you know, I'm pretty opinionated when it comes to programming.  I've been doing it forever, 
and my experience with that, combined with developing large open-source programming projects, 
combined with doing code review as an expert witness, have given me quite a bit of perspective.
<p>
I'm going to give you some opinions and recommendations now, with respect to C++ and object
oriented programming.  You don't have to heed these, but you should take serious consideration
of them, and think about why I make them.  I'll tell you that I am strict with respect to these,
and I expect the students who work for me to be strict as well.  Here we go:

<OL>
<LI> <b>Variable declarations should come before code, and not be intermixed</b>.
<p>
In both C and C++, you can declare variables pretty much anywhere.  I declare variables at
the top of my procedures, before any code.  That way, you know where to look for them, and
you know that they are not undergoing any changes until the first line of real code.
It makes the code readable, and easy to reason about.  I am sure I'm in the minority here,
but again, I have a <i>lot</i> of experience.  When you read my code, you know where to
find stuff.
<p>
It's much more convenient for the programmer to violate this.  Let's take stringstreams
for example.  When I read a line of text and convert it to a vector of strings, I do the
following:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int main()
{
  istringstream ss;
  vector &lt;string&gt; sv;
  string line, word;

  while (getline(cin, line)) {
    ss.clear();
    sv.clear();
    ss.str(line);
    while (ss &gt;&gt; word) sv.push_back(word());
    ...
</pre></td></table></center><p>
   
It would be more convenient for me to simply declare <b>ss</b> and <b>sv</b> inside the loop:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int main()
{
  string line, word;

  while (getline(cin, line)) {
    istringstream ss;
    vector &lt;string&gt; sv;
    ss.str(line);
    while (ss &gt;&gt; word) sv.push_back(word);
    ...
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Now I don't have to call <b>clear()</b>.  I can tell you I intensely dislike code like this -- 
again, I want declarations before code, and I don't want those declarations to be executing 
things.  Then you know where to find stuff, and you have reasonable assurances what the state
of the stuff is when the first line of code is executed.  
<p>
Let me give you a really extreme example, in 
<b><a href=src/code_in_declarations.cpp>src/code_in_declarations.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

<font color=blue>/* Here's a program where the constructor has side effects on its parameter.
   By the time you're done declaring parameters, the value of i is 105. */</font>

class My_Class {
  public:
    My_Class(int &i);
};

My_Class::My_Class(int &i)
{
  i += 50;
}

int main()
{
  int i = 5;
  My_Class c1(i), c2(i);
  
  cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

As mentioned in the comments, by the time you print <b>i</b>, the two constructors have
changed its value to 105.  You may say that this is an extreme example, but once you start
intermixing variable declarations, code, and complex constructor operations, anything goes,
and you can get code like this.

<LI> <b>Class declarations should have <i>no executable code</i>.  That includes constructors that define defaults</b>.

This falls in with the above comments -- when class declarations don't have code, then you
don't have surprises, and you know where to look for things.  You'll note, that includes 
default-setting constructors, like:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class My_Class {
  public:
    My_Class() : i(5) {};
  protected:
    int i;
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<p>
<LI> <b>You should avoid parameterizing constructors, unless you use a class exclusively with pointers</b>.
<p>
This can be derived from the first recommendation.  If you declare an instance of a class as 
a local variable with parameters, you are executing code.  Often, you can't even declare it until
you have executed some code that lets you set its parameters.  Here's an example -- recall
from the Bitmatrix lab, that we defined a hash table of bitmatrices:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class BM_Hash {
  public:
    BM_Hash(int size);
  ...
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Now, suppose you want to create a hash table, and read the table's size from standard input.
When you use a pointer, the code is nice and clean:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
void main()
{
  int table_size;
  BM_Hash *hash_table;

  cin &lt;&lt; table_size;
  hash_table = new BM_Hash(table_size);
  ....
</pre></td></table></center><p>

If you don't want to use a pointer (and I know that y'all students don't want to use pointers),
you are forced to declare <b>hash_table</b> in the middle of your code:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
void main()
{
  int table_size;

  cin &lt;&lt; table_size;
  BM_Hash hash_table(table_size);
  ....
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Convenient?  Yes.  Easy to read and reason about?  No.  I don't do it.

<p>
<LI> <b>If you are going to declare instances of a class as local variables, don't parameterize the constructor.  That way, you can declare it wherever you want, and you don't have to worry about
errors.</b>
<p>
This may be inconvenient, because then you have to account for an "empty" instance of the class.
Let's use the hash table above to exemplify.  Its constructor takes a parameter - the table size.
For that reason, you never have an empty hash table.  On the flip side, if you are going to 
follow my rules, you'll always use a pointer to it, and you'll always have to call <b>new</b>
to create it.  Suppose instead that you don't have a 
parameter to the constructor.  Then, you don't even need a constructor -- when you create an
instance, the table will be empty.  You'll have to add a method, like <b>Set_Size()</b>, to 
set the hash table's size, and then in your other hash table methods, you'll have to take 
into account that the hash table may be empty, and return the appropriate errors.
<p>
So it's a trade-off, certainly in code complexity, but you get the ability to declare the 
class very easily as a local variable.  You also get the ability to resize a vector of the
class without specifying a default value.  There will be additional advantages when we get
around to maps as well.  
<p>
So consider that, when you are designing your classes.

<LI> <b>Remember copy constructors and assignment overloads</b>.
<p>
When someone else uses your class, they will very reasonably expect to be able to make copies
of class instances, either through a procedure call, or through the assignment operator.  
You should do the following:

<p>
<UL>
<LI> If the default copy constructor and assignment behavior work, that's great!
<LI> If they don't, but it makes sense to write your own copy constructor and assignment overload,
     then do it.
<LI> If it doesn't make sense to write your own, then <i>disable</i> them.  You can do that as
follows:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class My_Class {
  public:
    My_Class(const MyClass &c) = delete;
    My_Class& operator= (const My_Class &cc) = delete;
....
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Now, if a user attempts an operation that would call the copy constructor or assignment
overlead, the compiler will emit an error.  This is <i>much</i> better than ignoring the 
copy constructor, and then having it not work when someone calls it.
</UL>
<p>
Since someone is bound to ask me about this, you can define a "move" constructor as well
in the later versions of C++ (11 and beyond).  The point of this is to optimize performance
when you return a large data structure from a procedure/method.  
Move constructors are beyond the scope of this class, sorry.

</UL>
<LI> <b>With one exception, when you throw an exception, the "try/catch" code that catches
     it should be in the same procedure in which it is thrown.  The one exception is when
     you throw an exception from a constructor (because you can't avoid it).</b>
<p>
If you adhere to this rule, you will avoid a <i>ton</i> of mistakes that come from the
odd flow-of-control when you catch exceptions in other procedures.  Think about the 
program above that threw the exception in <b>p3()</b>, and caught it in <b>main()</b>.
Since it calls all of those destructors on the way, the code is confusing and obtuse.
</UL>

<LI> <b>Be very careful with pointers into the internals of data structures, such as
        strings and vectors (and later sets and maps).  This is because strings and vectors
        move their data around as they resize, and you'll be left with a stale pointer.</b>
        
<p>
I'm going to give two example programs here.  The first is in
<b><a href=src/vector_pointer.cpp>src/vector_pointer.cpp</a></b>

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* A program to demonstrate why it is dangerous to hold a pointer to
   an element of a vector, because it may get moved. */</font>

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  vector &lt;string&gt; v;
  string *sp;
  string line;

  while (getline(cin, line)) {
    v.push_back(line); 
    if (v.size() == 1) sp = &(v[0]);          <font color=blue>// I set sp to point to the first string in v.</font>
    cout &lt;&lt; v.size() &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; *sp &lt;&lt; endl;   <font color=blue>// I then print v's size, and *sp.</font>
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

This program reads lines from standard input, and pushes them onto v.  It sets sp to
point to the first string in <b>v</b>, right after it is put onto v.  At the end of every
iteration, it prints v's size and *sp.  Let's see it in action:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat files/input.txt</b></font>
Kaylee Hex
Abigail Piezoelectric MD
Charlie Waive
Gabriel Oshkosh
Lucas Some
Maya Extravaganza
Isaiah Stiletto
Cooper Encumber
Kayla Littleneck
Lillian Coroutine
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat files/input.txt | bin/vector_pointer </b></font>
1 Kaylee Hex
2 Kaylee Hex
Segmentation fault
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

That's not good.  What happened?  When the program called <b>v.push_back("Charlie Waive")</b>,
the vector needed more memory, so it resized itself to a different memory location, and then
copied the strings that were in the old location to the new location.  And then they deleted
the old location.  Frankly, this could have happend after 
<b>v.push_back("Abigail Piezoelectric MD")</b>, and the memory at <b>sp</b> didn't get reused
until 
<b>v.push_back("Charlie Waive")</b>.  Regardless, after 
<b>v.push_back("Charlie Waive")</b>, the memory pointed to by <b>sp</b> has been changed so that
it is no longer a string, and we are alerted to it by the segmentation violation.
Keep that in mind.

<p>
Here's a second example, that got me when I was first using exceptions.  If you throw
a string literal, like:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
throw("Error");
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The type of the argument is <b>(const char *)</b>, which means that to catch it, you need
to do:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
catch (const char *s) {
</pre></td></table></center><p>
<p>
Suppose that you've already written the code to throw a string literal, and then later in the
same constructor, you want to construct a custom error message as a string and throw the
string.  Unfortunately, you can't catch it with the statement above -- it has to catch a string.  
So, to avoid writing a second <b>catch()</b> statement and possiblyl duplicate code,
what I did was throw the <b>c_str()</b> method of the string.  Let me demonstrate with
some code, in 
<b><a href=src/exception_char_star.cpp>src/exception_char_star.cpp</a></b>.  I'll start
with the class definition, and the constructor, which thows a string literal when <b>a</b>
equals zero, and uses a stringstream to construct an error string when <b>a &lt; 0</b>.
It then converts the stringstream to a string and uses the <b>c_str()</b> method so that
it is throwing a <b>(const char *)</b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class My_Class {
  public:
    My_Class(int a);
};

My_Class::My_Class(int a)
{
  ostringstream oss;

  if (a == 0) throw("Bad constructor for My_Class().  A shouldn't equal zero.");

  if (a &lt; 0) {
    oss &lt;&lt; "Bad constructor for My_Class().  A shouldn't equal " &lt;&lt; a ;
    throw(oss.str().c_str());
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

In the <b>main()</b> I call <b>new</b>, first when <b>a</b> is zero, and then again 
when <b>a</b> is negative.  

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* Here, I catch (const char *)'s rather than strings. */</font>

int main()
{
  My_Class *cp;

  try {                        <font color=blue>// This one works fine, because the string literal is </font>
    cp = new My_Class(0);      <font color=blue>// really a global variable.</font>
  } catch (const char *s) {
    printf("%s\n", s);
  }
   
  try {                        <font color=blue>// This one doesn't work, because the oss's destructor is called, </font>
    cp = new My_Class(-5);     <font color=blue>// and the memory pointed to by s has been freed up (and reused)</font>
  } catch (const char *s) {
    printf("%s\n", s);
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The first <b>throw()</b> gets caught fine, because that
string literal is a global variable.  The second <b>throw</b> gets caught, but because
the constructor has exited, the stringstream has been deallocated (actually, technically,
the string created by the <b>str()</b> method has been deallocated).  That means that the
pointer that was returned by <b>c_str()</b> is no longer valid.
<p>
When we run it, the second <b>catch()</b> prints an empty string.  To be honest with you,
anything could happen there.  It just happens to print an empty string on my Macintosh.

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/exception_char_star</b></font>
Bad constructor for My_Class().  A shouldn't equal zero.

UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

The solution to this is to always throw strings.  If you have a string literal, put
<b>(string)</b> in front of it, so that the <b>throw()</b> statement throws a string:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
throw((string) "Error");
</pre></td></table></center><p>
</UL>
