<h3>String Basics</h3>

Strings are a fundamental class supported by C++ to do text processing.
<p>
They are very natural, so you can often write programs with them
without thinking about it too much.  For example, the following program 
(<b><a href=string-basic.cpp>string-basic.cpp</a></b>)
illustrates many functionalities with strings:

<p>
<UL>
<LI> Assigning them from string literals.
<LI> Using <b>size()</b> to determine their size.
<LI> Changing their contents by treating them like an array.
<LI> Testing equality using "=="
<LI> Comparing them using "<", etc.
<LI> Concatenating them with "+".
</UL>

<p>I'm assuming that all of this is review from CS102.

<b><a href=string-basic.cpp>string-basic.cpp</a></b>

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program illustrates some basical functionalities with strings. */</font>

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  string a, b, c;
  size_t i;

  <font color=blue>/* String assignment from literals. */</font>

  a = "LIGHTNING";
  b = "Lightning";
  c = "Strikes";

  <font color=blue>/* Printing out strings and their sizes. */</font>

  cout &lt;&lt; "a: " &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; " -- " &lt;&lt; a.size() &lt;&lt; " characters." &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "b: " &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; " -- " &lt;&lt; b.size() &lt;&lt; " characters." &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "c: " &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; " -- " &lt;&lt; c.size() &lt;&lt; " characters." &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; endl;

  <font color=blue>/* Modifying a string. */</font>

  printf("Changing all but the first character of a to lower case:\n\n");

  for (i = 1; i &lt; a.size(); i++) a[i] += ('a' - 'A');
  cout &lt;&lt; "Changed a to: " &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; endl;

  <font color=blue>/* Testing equality and comparison. */</font>

  printf("Testing equality: (a == b): %d.  (a == c): %d.  (b == c): %d\n", (a == b), (a == c), (b == c));

  printf("Comparison:       (a &gt;= b): %d.  (a &gt;= c): %d.  (b &gt;= c): %d\n", (a &gt;= b), (a &gt;= c), (b &gt;= c));
  printf("Comparison:       (a &lt;= b): %d.  (a &lt;= c): %d.  (b &lt;= c): %d\n", (a &lt;= b), (a &lt;= c), (b &lt;= c));
  printf("Comparison:       (a &lt;  b): %d.  (a &lt;  c): %d.  (b &lt;  c): %d\n", (a &lt;  b), (a &lt;  c), (b &lt;  c));
  printf("Comparison:       (a &gt;  b): %d.  (a &gt;  c): %d.  (b &gt;  c): %d\n", (a &gt;  b), (a &gt;  c), (b &gt;  c));
  cout &lt;&lt; endl;

  <font color=blue>/* Showing how addition is overloaded to do string concatenation. */</font>

  a = b + c;
  cout &lt;&lt; "a = b + c: a is now: " &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; endl;

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Nothing surprising happens when we run this:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>g++ -o string-basic string-basic.cpp</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>string-basic</b></font>
a: LIGHTNING -- 9 characters.
b: Lightning -- 9 characters.
c: Strikes -- 7 characters.

Changing all but the first character of a to lower case:

Changed a to: Lightning

Testing equality: (a == b): 1.  (a == c): 0.  (b == c): 0
Comparison:       (a >= b): 1.  (a >= c): 0.  (b >= c): 0
Comparison:       (a <= b): 1.  (a <= c): 1.  (b <= c): 1
Comparison:       (a <  b): 0.  (a <  c): 1.  (b <  c): 1
Comparison:       (a >  b): 0.  (a >  c): 0.  (b >  c): 0

a = b + c: a is now: LightningStrikes
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Those last three functionalities (comparison and concatenation) exploit a
feature of C++ that you may learn more about someday.  It's called "operator
overloading," which allows you to redefine basic operators in the language
to work on user-defined objects.  In this case, '==', '<=', '>=', '<', '>'
and '+' have all been defined to work on strings.   It's pretty convenient
in this case, but you should know that I'm not a fan of operator overloading
in general.  Put that in the back of your mind.

<h2>Getline()</h2>

The procedure <b>getline(cin, s)</b> 
reads a line of input from standard input and puts it into the string <b>s</b>. 
Spaces are preserved.   Later, we will use <b>getline()</b> and stringstreams to 
process input.  However, here, we simply read lines of standard input with 
<b>getline()</b> (this in <b><a href=getline.cpp>getline.cpp</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program uses getline() to read lines of text, and print their line numbers and size. */</font>

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  string s;
  int ln, len;

  ln = 0;
  while (getline(cin, s)) {
    ln++;
    len = s.size();
    printf("Line %2d - Size: %3d - %s\n", ln, len, s.c_str());
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Running it, we see that it works as promised:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>g++ -o getline getline.cpp</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>head -n 5 input.txt</b></font>                        <font color=blue># head -n x prints the first x lines of a file.</font>

<h3>Vector Basics</h3>

Vectors are the simplest part of the Standard Template Library (STL).  There's
a lot of linguistic hocus pocus that has to go on for the STL to work as it does.
We won't concern ourselves with that in this class, but we will teach you how to 
make use of the library effectively.   Vectors are a general-purpose array class.
To use a vector, you include <b>&lt;vector&gt;</b>, and then you declare a vector as 
follows:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
vector &lt;<b>TYPE</b>&gt; <b>variable-name(size)</b>  <font color=blue>// The size is optional</font>
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The <b>TYPE</b> can be a basic type like <b>int</b> or <b>double</b>, or it can 
be more complex, like a C++ class or even another vector.  You can declare a vector
as starting with a certain number of elements, or you can declare it to be empty.
In either case, you can dynamically modify the vector's size with the <b>resize()</b>
method.  You can use the <b>size()</b> method to get the vector's current size.
<p>
A very simple example program is in 
<b><a href=vec1.cpp>vec1.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* A simple program to show the basics of vectors:
     - Declaring them.
     - Checking their size
     - Resizing
     - Setting values;
 */</font>

#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  vector &lt;int&gt; v1;
  vector &lt;double&gt; v2(10);
  size_t i;

  <font color=blue>/* Print out v1's size and v2's size.  It is unfortunate that size() returns
     an "size_t", which is an unsigned long, instead of an int, so you must use
     "%lu" or "%ld" instead of %d inside printf().  We'll talk about it in class.  */</font>

  printf("V1's size: %lu.  V2's size: %lu\n", v1.size(), v2.size());

  <font color=blue>/* Resize the vectors and print out the new sizes. */</font>

  v1.resize(5);
  v2.resize(8);
  printf("V1's size: %lu.  V2's size: %lu\n", v1.size(), v2.size());

  <font color=blue>/* Set the vectors' values, and print them out. */</font>

  for (i = 0; i &lt; v1.size(); i++) v1[i] = 10 + i;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; v2.size(); i++) v2[i] = 20.3 + i;

  printf("V1:"); 
  for (i = 0; i &lt; v1.size(); i++) printf(" %d", v1[i]); 
  printf("\n");

  printf("V2:"); 
  for (i = 0; i &lt; v2.size(); i++) printf(" %.1lf", v2[i]);
  printf("\n");

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>
This program declares an empty integer vector <b>v1</b> and a ten-element
double vector <b>v2</b>, and prints their sizes.  It then resizes the 
vectors to five and eight and prints their sizes again.  It then initializes
the elements of <b>v1</b> and <b>v2</b> in two <b>for</b> loops and prints out the
two vectors.  Straightforward stuff:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./vec1</b></font>
V1's size: 0.  V2's size: 10
V1's size: 5.  V2's size: 8
V1: 10 11 12 13 14
V2: 20.3 21.3 22.3 23.3 24.3 25.3 26.3 27.3
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

One note -- when you print a <b>size()</b> with <b>printf()</b>, you need to 
specify "%lu" or "%ld" instead of "%d".  This is because sizes are 64-bit, unsigned quantities.  
If you don't do it, you will get a compiler warning.  Similarly, you'll want to declare
<b>i</b> to be a <b>size_t</b>, which again is an unsigned long. Otherwise, you'll get
compiler warnings when you compare <b>i</b> to <b>v1.size()</b>.

<p>
When you create array elements, default values are placed in there.  For example,
string arrays start with default empty strings.  Numerical values should be zero, but
frankly I'd be leery of trusting that.  You can specify what the default values should
be as a second parameter to the <b>resize()</b> method.
<p>
Take a careful look at 
<b><a href=vec2.cpp>vec2.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program shows some subtleties of resizing vectors. */</font>

#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  vector &lt;int&gt; v1;
  size_t i;

  <font color=blue>/* Start with two v1.resizes, setting new elements to 22 and 33. */</font>

  v1.resize(5, 22);
  v1.resize(8, 33);

  printf("Initial V1:            ");
  for (i = 0; i &lt; v1.size(); i++) printf(" %d", v1[i]); 
  printf("\n");

  <font color=blue>/* Chop it down to six elements. */</font>

  v1.resize(6);
  printf("v1.resize(6):          ");
  for (i = 0; i &lt; v1.size(); i++) printf(" %d", v1[i]); 
  printf("\n");

  <font color=blue>/* Now resize to 10 elements, setting the new ones to 44. */</font>

  v1.resize(10, 44);
  printf("v1.resize(10, 44):     ");
  for (i = 0; i &lt; v1.size(); i++) printf(" %d", v1[i]); 
  printf("\n");

  <font color=blue>/* Does this add 5 new random elements, or 5 copies of one random element? */</font>

  v1.resize(15, rand());
  printf("v1.resize(15, rand()): ");
  for (i = 0; i &lt; v1.size(); i++) printf(" %d", v1[i]); 
  printf("\n");

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

We first resize <b>v1</b> to hold five elements that are 22, and then we
resize <b>v2</b> to hold eight elements with a default of 33.  This raises
a question -- will only the new elements be 33, or will all of them?  Look 
at the output:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./vec2</b></font>
Initial V1:             22 22 22 22 22 33 33 33
v1.resize(6):           22 22 22 22 22 33
v1.resize(10, 44):      22 22 22 22 22 33 44 44 44 44
v1.resize(15, rand()):  22 22 22 22 22 33 44 44 44 44 16807 16807 16807 16807 16807
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Only the new ones are given values.  The third <b>resize()</b> removes two
elements, and then the fourth increases the size from 6 to 10, putting
the value of 44 into the new elements.
<p>
The last <b>resize()</b> adds 5 new elements and gives them a default of <b>rand()</b>,
which is a random integer.  You may wonder, will that create five different random numbers,
or five copies of one random number?  It is the latter, because the <b>resize()</b> command
simply calls <b>rand()</b> once, and its return value is passed to the <b>resize()</b> 
command.

<i>(BTW, I will discuss random numbers later in class).</i>

<hr>
<h3>push_back(), reverse, tail</h3>

Two canonical vector programs are <b>reverse.cpp</b> and <b>mytail.cpp</b>.
The first is really simple -- it prints out the lines of standard input in 
reverse order.  You need a data structure like a vector to do this, because you 
can't print the first line of output until you've read the last line of input,
and you have to store all of those lines somewhere.  
<p>
Here's
<b><a href=reverse.cpp>reverse.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program uses a vector to print standard input in reverse order. */</font>

#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  vector &lt;string&gt; lines;
  int i;
  string s;

  <font color=blue>/* Read every line of standard input into a vector called lines. */</font>

  while (getline(cin, s)) lines.push_back(s);

  <font color=blue>/* Now print lines in reverse order. */</font>

  for (i = lines.size()-1; i &gt;= 0; i--) cout &lt;&lt; lines[i] &lt;&lt; endl;

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

It makes use of the vector method <b>push_back()</b>, which appends an element to
a vector.  <b>push_back()</b> is guaranteed to run quickly, and it is much
more convenient than resizing the array.  
<p>
To show <b>reverse</b> running, I first call <b>cat -n</b> on <b>input.txt</b>.
That prints <b>input.txt</b> to the screen with line numbers.  

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat -n input.txt</b></font>

UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

You may have noticed that I didn't use a <b>size_t</b> for <b>i</b>, but instead used
an <b>int</b>.  That's because <b>size_t's</b> are unsigned quantities, and therefore cannot
assume negative values.  If you try to use a <b>size_t</b> for <b>i</b>, you'll get a 
compiler warning:

<pre>
<font color=darkred><b>reverse.cpp:19:30: warning: comparison of unsigned expression >= 0 is always true</b></font>
      [-Wtautological-compare]
  for (i = lines.size()-1; i >= 0; i--) cout << lines[i] << endl;
</pre>
 
Do you think it's a good thing that when <b>i</b> is a <b>size_t</b>, that it can't be
set to -1?  I personally don't, but no one asked me.  Be aware of it, and pay attention to
the warnings emitted by the compiler.

<p>
The second program performs the same functionality as the <b>tail</b> command -- 
it prints out the last ten lines of standard input.  We can write a simple version
of <b>tail</b> that is like <b>reverse.cpp</b>.  It reads all of the lines into 
a vector and then prints out just the last ten lines.  It's in 
<b><a href=mytail1.cpp>mytail1.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program prints out the last ten lines of a file, (or the whole file if it 
   has fewer than ten lines).  It reads all of the lines into a vector, and then
   prints out the last ten entries. */</font>

#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  vector &lt;string&gt; lines;
  size_t i;
  string s;

  <font color=blue>/* Read each line into the vector */</font>

  while (getline(cin, s)) lines.push_back(s);

  <font color=blue>/* Compute the first line to print */</font>

  if (lines.size() &lt; 10) {
    i = 0;
  } else {
    i = lines.size()-10;
  }

  <font color=blue>/* And then print the lines. */</font>

  for ( ; i &lt; lines.size(); i++) cout &lt;&lt; lines[i] &lt;&lt; endl;

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>
We need the <b>if</b> statement to handle files that are smaller than 10 lines.
If we didn't have the <b>if</b> statement, then who knows what <i>i</i> would be
when we set it to <b>lines.size()-10</b>, because <b>size_t's</b> can't have negative
values.  Hopefully that bug would be manifested by a
segmentation violation, but you never know.  Since we've put in that <b>if</b>
statement, there is no bug:

<pre>

    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

I'll contend, though, that <b>mytail1.cpp</b> is not as good of a program
as it could be.  Why?  Consider
what happens if you call it on a file with 1,000,000 lines.  You are storing all
1,000,000 lines, but you are only printing the last ten.  That's a big
waste of memory!
<p>
This problem is fixed in
<b><a href=mytail2.cpp>mytail2.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* This program also prints out the last ten lines of standard input, however unlike
   mytail1.cpp, it only stores ten lines, rather than the entire file.  You keep track 
   of the total number of lines in the variable "ln", and you simply keep overwriting
   the strings in the "lines" vector, until you get to the end of the file. */</font>

#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  vector &lt;string&gt; lines;
  int i, ln;
  string s;

  <font color=blue>/* Read the lines into elements 0 through 9 of the vector "lines." */</font>

  ln = 0;
  while (getline(cin, s)) {
    if (ln &lt; 10) {
      lines.push_back(s);
    } else {
      lines[ln%10] = s;
    }    
    ln++;
  }

  <font color=blue>/* Set i to be (ln-10), or 0 if we haven't read ten lines. */</font>

  i = ln-10;
  if (i &lt; 0) i = 0;

  <font color=blue>/* Now print out the last ten lines. */</font>

  for ( ; i &lt; ln; i++) cout &lt;&lt; lines[i%10] &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>
Once <b>lines</b> becomes ten elements long, we no longer call <b>push_back()</b>, but
instead replace the oldest element with <b>s</b>.  When reading is done, we have the
last ten lines, but not always starting at element 0.  To print them out, we need to 
find the array element for each of the last ten lines.  Consider line <b>x</b>.  If it
is in the array, it will be in element <b>x%10</b>.  Thus, if the file has <b>ln</b> total 
lines and <b>ln &gt; 10</b>, then we want to print out lines <b>ln-10</b> to <b>ln-1</b>.
The <b>for</b> loop that ends the program does just that.
<p>
<h3>The compiler flags -Wall and -Wextra</h3>

You can put some extra flags on the command line when you compile, which will have the 
compiler emit more warnings than it normally does.  I have done this in the makefile:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>make clean</b></font>
rm -f core *.o string-basic mytail1 mytail2 reverse vec1 vec2 getline a.out
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>make</b></font>
g++ -Wall -Wextra -o string-basic string-basic.cpp
g++ -Wall -Wextra -o mytail1 mytail1.cpp
g++ -Wall -Wextra -o mytail2 mytail2.cpp
g++ -Wall -Wextra -o reverse reverse.cpp
g++ -Wall -Wextra -o vec1 vec1.cpp
g++ -Wall -Wextra -o vec2 vec2.cpp
g++ -Wall -Wextra -o getline getline.cpp
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

I recommend doing this, and then I recommend making sure that your programs don't emit
warnings when you compile them.  It can be a pain to fix your code so that it doesn't
emit warnings, but in doing so, you often catch bugs, so it's worth it.
