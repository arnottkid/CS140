Give me a weapon of power, which no one else may hold,
Defend the Gods with honor, To lead the BRAVE and BOLD

    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN

Bequeathed to me by Odin, Molded by the Dwarfs
MINE! This shimmering mallet, The Symbol of the Norse

    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
